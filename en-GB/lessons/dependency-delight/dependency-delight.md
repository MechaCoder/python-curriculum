We are going to have a project that you can share useing freands and other people Created by Matthew Proudman. the exsample.

## prerequisites
1. make sure that virtualenv is installed, `virtualenv --version` virtualenv is a tool used to create and mange virtual envioments.

2. make sure that pip is installed `pip -V`, pip is used to handle the installing and mangeing packages and projects witen by other people.

## new concepts
### Dependencice
A Dependencice is a project that someone else has writen for you to use, it is important to remember, that you can also many versions.

### virtual envoiment
A virtual envoiment is esentalay a box where you project can you install and run your code this also means that when you share code you also a clear list of the tools you have used. in python and python3 is 'virtualenv'. in javaScript you can 'npm'

### pip
pip is a tool that is useded to install the tools or 'packages', once you have created a virtual envoiment you will be alble to install packages. in this project we will be using the following commands, `pip install [packages name]`, `pip uninstall [package name]` and `pip freeze > [filename]`.
